# What is it?

The lesson "Remaining Time" block is a simple block that can be added only to lesson pages
to show the time remaining before the user has met the time requirement of a lesson. This
provides better transparency to users whether they have met the that requirement in the
lesson.

## How to Use It

When the plugin is installed, it does not automatically appear. You must add the block to
the page where you want it to appear.

To add the block:

   - As an administrator/author, navigate to the course.
   - Turn on editing by clicking "Turn editing on".
   - Navigate to the lesson you want to display the "Time Remaining" block.
   - At the bottom of the left-hand menu, click "Add a block", and select the "Remaining
     Time Block" option.

The "Remaining Time" block will now appear on this lesson.

Remember, this block is configured to *only* display on lesson pages. So, if you navigate
to another type of page and try to add it, it will not appear as an available block to
add.

## Installation

Download the plugin from the
[releases](https://github.com/uicpharm/moodle-block_lesson_remaining_time/releases) page
and install it using the Moodle admin interface.

There are no required configurations. The customization just has to be installed.
